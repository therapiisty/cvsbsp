# A HALF LIFE 2 MOD. CREATED BY DARPA EXPERIMENT SIMULATVRS PUBLIC EXECUTIVE BRANCH

## REQUIREMENTS
- Half-Life: Episode Two
- Source SDK 2013 Singleplayer
- Mapbase HL2, Shared and Episodic (included in every release)

## INSTALLATION
Simply move the extracted contents of the release (all three mapbase folders + cvsbsp) to "steamapps/sourcemods"; which is typically located in the Steam directory on your C: drive or wherever you initially installed Steam.

## DESCRIPTION

Ever wondered what it would feel like to be in the shoes of Jeremiah Sedam? Well, you'll never be half as cool, strong, have half of his blood coagulation rate and you'll never have his 20-inch penis. (<-- real thing he said btw)

But this simulator comes pretty damn close. Shoot your way through a CVS and its underground labyrinth, all while hunting down your target, Adrian -- a suspicious Mexican kid whose "family better be legal, or else I'm coming after them next". That might sound bad, but the price on his head is more than worth it, at a whole ONE MILLION pesos. Just be prepared to hide under the bed for four hours while writing your defection letter to Russia after playing this ULTRA REALISTIC SHOOTER EXPERIENCE. You'll feel like you're really there, trust me.
